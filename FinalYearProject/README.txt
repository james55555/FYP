Final Year Project
This project looks to create a Time Management System for Professionals managing small to medium sized projects.

The system is being designed using RUP and will be designed using four iterations, each advancing in complexity.

The system has been designed based on the Model-View-Controller architecture.
This is more clear when viewing the \Includes namespace folder structure.
